A terminal text editor based off of kilo from https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/
So far added everything till the Delete key but adding PAGE_UP and PAGE_DOWN key broke wasd navigation on Mac. Will try with an external keyboard.

--TODO--
1. Everything remaining 
2. Additional features like auto indentation, copy-paste shortcuts, etc.
